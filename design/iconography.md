# Iconography

Iconography is where the symbol becomes a “system.”

## Style rules

- High contrast silhouette first
- Texture second (spray, grain, marble)
- Typography last (should never be the only hook)

## Typography (guideline)

- Use type like you’d use a stencil: **functional, not decorative**.
- Keep it legible.
- Let the image carry the mood.

## Color (guideline)

- Treat gold like a scarce material.
- Use it to highlight fractures, not to flood the whole piece.

## File discipline

- Originals stay editable.
- Exports stay clean.
- If the pipeline breaks, fix the pipeline — don’t ship a compromised artifact.
