# Symbols

Symbols are the compression algorithm of the brand.

This section defines a few recurring marks so the aesthetic stays coherent across drops.

## Core set (starter)

- **Laurel** — victory / survival / continuity
- **Cracks / kintsugi gold** — damage acknowledged, not hidden
- **Bust / statue** — time, memory, civilization
- **Fortuna** — chance, volatility, fate
- **Gambler** — risk, agency, consequence

## Constraints

- Symbols must read at **3 feet**.
- Details should reward **12 inches**.
- Avoid symbols that require text to make sense.
