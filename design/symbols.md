title: "Symbols"
---

This page catalogs symbolic encodings used in the Codex and Obelisk projects.

Each entry records:

- the symbol or mark
- what it represents
- how its meaning is taught without language
- where it appears in the system

This is not a design manifesto.  
It is an inventory.

---

## Format

Each symbol entry should follow this structure:

### Symbol: <name or glyph>

**Category:** numeral / operator / structural / physical mark / diagrammatic / other

**Represents:**  
What the symbol encodes.

**Teaching Method:**  
How its meaning is inferred visually or through pattern alone.

**Redundancy:**  
What reinforces the interpretation (repetition, equivalence, scaling, contrast, etc.).

**First Appearance:**  
Where it is introduced in the Codex or Obelisk.

**Notes:**  
Edge cases, ambiguity risks, or future revisions.

## Encoded Symbols

(Active inventory below.)

---

### Symbol: 0

**Category:** numeral

**Represents:**  
Absence of quantity.

**Teaching Method:**  
Shown adjacent to counted marks while having none beneath it; paired with operations such as `1 + 0 = 1`.

**Redundancy:**  
Null tally, identity in addition and subtraction.

**First Appearance:**  
Arithmetic primer panel.

**Notes:**  
Serves as anchor for positional notation.

---

### Symbol: 1–9

**Category:** numeral

**Represents:**  
Discrete quantities.

**Teaching Method:**  
Mapped directly to increasing tally groups.

**Redundancy:**  
Repeated across addition and multiplication examples.

**First Appearance:**  
Arithmetic primer panel.

**Notes:**  
Grouped in fives to emphasize aggregation.

---

### Symbol: =

**Category:** operator

**Represents:**  
Equivalence between expressions.

**Teaching Method:**  
Pairs different representations of the same quantity.

**Redundancy:**  
Used in multiple arithmetic contexts.

**First Appearance:**  
Arithmetic primer panel.

**Notes:**  
None.

---

### Symbol: +

**Category:** operator

**Represents:**  
Combination of quantities.

**Teaching Method:**  
Shown alongside tally groups being merged into larger totals.

**Redundancy:**  
Cross-checked with numeral results.

**First Appearance:**  
Arithmetic primer panel.

**Notes:**  
Associative and commutative properties implied later.

---

### Symbol: −

**Category:** operator

**Represents:**  
Removal of quantity.

**Teaching Method:**  
Illustrated through reduction of tallies and numeric decrease.

**Redundancy:**  
Multiple scales shown.

**First Appearance:**  
Arithmetic primer panel.

**Notes:**  
Zero interactions explicitly demonstrated.

---

### Symbol: *

**Category:** operator

**Represents:**  
Repeated grouping (multiplication).

**Teaching Method:**  
Second operand shown as repeated addition of the first.

**Redundancy:**  
Confirmed through numeral and tally equivalence.

**First Appearance:**  
Arithmetic primer panel.

**Notes:**  
Orientation symmetry may be expanded.

---

### Symbol: Powers of Ten

**Category:** numeral structure

**Represents:**  
Decimal scaling.

**Teaching Method:**  
Repeated multiplication by ten generating increasing orders of magnitude.

**Redundancy:**  
Multiple tiers shown (10, 100, 1,000, …).

**First Appearance:**  
Arithmetic primer panel.

**Notes:**  
Establishes positional number system.

---

## Reserved Sections

Future symbol classes may include:

- division and ratios
- fractions
- geometric primitives
- coordinate systems
- physical measurement units
- temporal markers
- astronomical references

These will be added as inventory entries, not essays.

---

## Status

This page is maintained as a working catalog.

Symbols graduate from experimental sketches into this list once their teaching method is judged robust under long-horizon assumptions.
