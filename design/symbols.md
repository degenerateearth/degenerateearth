title: "Symbols"
---

This document defines symbol principles for the Codex.

Symbols are treated here as tools for **compression, disambiguation, and survival**—not decoration and not identity.

A symbol is acceptable only if it improves long-term interpretability.

---

## Purpose

Written language is brittle across time.
Symbols can fail too, but they can fail more slowly when designed with constraint.

This section exists to:
- define what a symbol must do to be admissible
- specify how symbols should be constructed and annotated
- prevent drift into aesthetic or cultural specificity

---

## Constraints

A Codex symbol system should be:

- **Low-assumption**  
  It must not depend on contemporary culture, language, or shared mythology.

- **Reconstructible**  
  A careful reader should be able to infer meaning from local context and repeated usage.

- **Composable**  
  Symbols should combine into larger expressions without ambiguity.

- **Redundant**  
  Important meanings should be expressible more than one way (symbol + words + structure).

- **Physically representable**  
  Symbols should be drawable, engravable, and distinguishable under wear.

- **Error-tolerant**  
  Minor damage should not invert meaning.

---

## Symbol classes

The Codex uses symbols in limited, explicit categories.

### 1) Structural markers
Used to mark boundaries and hierarchy.

Examples (conceptual):
- section boundary
- warning boundary
- definition boundary
- example boundary

Rule: structure symbols must describe **form**, not content.

---

### 2) Relations
Used to express relationships that can be reasoned about.

Examples:
- equals / not-equals
- implies
- greater-than / less-than
- subset / contains
- causes / depends-on (only when defined)

Rule: relation symbols must be paired with at least one written example when introduced.

---

### 3) Quantities and measurement
Used to communicate number, magnitude, units, and scale.

Principle: numbers should be grounded in a reconstructible baseline whenever possible
(e.g., counting marks, ratios, periodic phenomena).

Rule: when a unit is introduced, define it by relation to something else that can be observed or derived.

---

### 4) Risk and hazard markers
Used to communicate danger, irreversibility, or high consequence.

Risk symbols must be visually distinct and not easily confused with structural markers.

Rule: hazard symbols must always be accompanied by written language and redundancy
(e.g., repetition, framing, pictorial hint if available).

---

## Introduction protocol

No symbol is considered “known” by default.

When introducing a new symbol, include:

1. **Name** (plain language)
2. **Shape description** (so it can be reconstructed)
3. **Meaning** (one sentence)
4. **Non-meaning** (what it does *not* mean)
5. **Example usage**
6. **Failure mode** (how it could be misread)

If any of these cannot be supplied, the symbol should not be introduced.

---

## Style rules

To reduce confusion over time:

- Prefer **simple strokes** over intricate detail
- Avoid reliance on **color**
- Avoid reliance on **fine line weight**
- Avoid mirrored pairs that can invert meaning when rotated
- Avoid symbols that resemble letters from a specific alphabet
- Avoid symbols that resemble contemporary logos or icons

---

## Redundancy rule

For any critical meaning, symbols are *never* the sole carrier.

Use at least two of:
- written definition
- repeated contextual usage
- diagram or structured example
- alternative phrasing or equivalent relation

If meaning is important, it should survive partial loss.

---

## Drift prevention

Symbols accumulate cultural associations over time.

To prevent drift:
- do not introduce symbols for style
- do not introduce symbols to “brand” the Codex
- prefer function-driven forms
- when in doubt, write it out

---

## Status

This file defines constraints, not a complete symbol lexicon.

The lexicon should grow slowly and only when demanded by clarity or survivability.

Any symbol not defined in this Codex should be treated as unknown.
