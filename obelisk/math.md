# Math Primer

This is the “ramp.” The goal is to teach enough math that diagrams and measurements become self-explanatory.

## 1) Counting

- Tally marks
- Grouping (suggest base‑10 or base‑12, but show both)
- Place value (a symbol for “ten”, “hundred”, etc.)

## 2) Measurement

- A unit of length
- A unit of time
- Area and volume as repeated measurement

## 3) Geometry

- Point, line, angle
- Triangle basics
- Right angle and the idea of perpendicular

## 4) Ratios & fractions

Teach ratio with pictures:

- half, third, quarter
- scaling diagrams up/down

## 5) Coordinates

- Draw a grid
- Label axes
- Show plotting points

## Why this matters

Once a reader understands:

- how to count
- how to measure
- how to read a diagram

…you can encode almost anything that fits on a page.
