title: Obelisk
---


The Obelisk is an experimental knowledge-preservation project whose goal is to **sequentially encode the foundations of mathematics, geometry, physics, and astronomy into a single physical monument**.

The intended form is literal: a stone or glass obelisk, carved or etched with marks that guide an unknown reader from basic quantity and spatial reasoning toward an understanding of the physical universe.

This project is not concerned with *what* knowledge is true, but with **whether understanding can be reconstructed at all** after civilizational collapse.

This project assumes a future in which:
- Language has fractured or vanished
- Cultural continuity is broken
- Tools, machines, and digital media are absent
- The reader begins with no shared symbols, units, or conventions

The Obelisk asks a single question:

> *If all memory is lost, can understanding be rebuilt from stone alone?*

---

## Purpose

The Obelisk is not an archive of facts.

It is a series of **reconstruction attempts**: step-by-step efforts to encode foundational ideas — especially mathematical and physical ones — such that an unknown intelligence could *rediscover* them without prior instruction.

The emphasis is not on efficiency or completeness, but on **legibility under extreme assumptions**.

---

## Relation to the Prometheus Project

The Obelisk is the practical arm of the Prometheus Project.

Where Prometheus is concerned with long-horizon preservation, the Obelisk confronts the harder problem of **recoverability**: whether preserved marks can actually lead to understanding.

Many entries originate from direct attempts to reconstruct mathematics as if carving into stone:
- No alphabet
- No spoken language
- No assumed numeracy
- No culturally inherited diagrams

If a concept cannot be derived through:
- physical marks,
- spatial relationships,
- repetition,
- and logical necessity,

then it is considered a failure of encoding — not of the reader.

---

## Method

Each Obelisk entry is treated as a **self-contained teaching experiment**.

Assumptions must be made explicit.
Each step must justify the next.
Symbols must be earned, not declared.

Failures, dead ends, and ambiguities are preserved intentionally.
They document where understanding collapses under insufficient scaffolding.

Progress is measured not by elegance, but by **recoverability**.

---

## Constraints

All Obelisk material must adhere to the following constraints:
- Carvable in stone or etchable in glass
- Understandable without language
- Independent of culture, technology, or tradition
- Resistant to symbol drift and misinterpretation

Anything that cannot survive these constraints does not belong here.

---

## Status

The Obelisk is a living draft.

Nothing here is finalized.
Nothing here is guaranteed to work.
Material may be revised, abandoned, or removed as reconstruction attempts succeed or fail.

This section exists to confront the hardest problem in knowledge preservation:

> *Knowing something is not the same as being able to teach it from zero.*

---

## Sections

This section contains individual reconstruction attempts.
Each will stand alone and make no assumptions beyond physical perception and time.

---

## Face One — Numerals and Arithmetic

**Objective:**  
Establish a complete, language-independent foundation for arithmetic.

This face attempts to teach:

- discrete counting
- zero
- abstract numerals
- equality
- addition
- subtraction
- multiplication
- decimal scaling and powers of ten

No linguistic assumptions are made. Meaning is conveyed only through physical grouping, repetition, visual equivalence, and pattern.

---

### Scope

Face One is limited to operations necessary to bootstrap further mathematical reasoning. It avoids fractions, division, geometry, or measurement systems, which are reserved for later faces.

---

### Teaching Strategy

Concepts are introduced in ascending dependency:

1. tally marks → quantity  
2. numerals → compression of tallies  
3. equivalence (`=`)  
4. addition and subtraction  
5. multiplication as repeated grouping  
6. ten as a scaling constant  
7. powers of ten

Each operation is demonstrated redundantly at multiple magnitudes.

---

### Status

Draft.

The layout has not yet been tested against erosion, partial loss, or mis-ordering.

Interpretation experiments are ongoing.
