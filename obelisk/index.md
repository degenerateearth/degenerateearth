# Obelisk

**Obelisk** is the pillar project: a practical blueprint for preserving knowledge across collapse, censorship, and long time.

The idea is simple:

> The ancient world left us stone, sealed rooms, and durable marks.
> We should leave the next world *instructions* — not treasure.

This section is written as if a stranger might find it centuries later.

## Sections

- [Encoding](./encoding/)
- [Materials](./materials/)
- [Math Primer](./math/)
- [Warnings](./warnings/)

## Design goals

- **Low-tech readability** (starts at scratches and shapes)
- **Layered teaching** (from counting → measurement → geometry → diagrams)
- **Redundancy** (multiple paths to the same meaning)
- **Error tolerance** (partial damage shouldn’t erase the whole message)

## Status

This is a living draft. The Codex favors *clarity over completeness*.
