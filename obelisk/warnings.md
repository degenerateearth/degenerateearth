# Warnings

The Obelisk isn’t a fantasy. It’s engineering under uncertainty.

## Don’t assume the reader is “friendly”

If the message contains power, someone will try to control it.

- Avoid single points of failure.
- Avoid instructions that require rare materials.
- Prefer **principles** over “press this button.”

## Don’t assume the reader shares your values

Write as if the reader is intelligent but culturally alien.

- Use visuals.
- Repeat key concepts.
- Show examples.

## Don’t overfit the future

The future might not have:

- electricity
- precision tools
- your units
- your language

Make the first layer survivable without them.

## Ethical line

This Codex aims to preserve **capability** and **understanding**, not recipes for harm.

If something is dual‑use, prefer the version that teaches fundamentals and safety constraints.
