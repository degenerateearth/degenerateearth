# Encoding

The problem: **how do you encode meaning so a future reader can decode it without your language, your culture, or your software?**

The answer is not one trick — it’s layers.

## Layer 0 — Marks that mean “count”

Start with tally logic:

- A single mark means **one**.
- Equal spacing implies **separate units**.
- Grouping implies **base / structure**.

This is the first bridge because it doesn’t need translation.

## Layer 1 — Reference standards

Create a shared ruler and clock using nature:

- **Length**: define a unit from a stable physical phenomenon (e.g., wavelength reference) and then provide a physical scale.
- **Time**: define from a repeatable oscillation (atomic transition references are ideal; mechanical approximations can be taught).

If the reader can reproduce the standard, measurements become portable.

## Layer 2 — Visual dictionary

Use pictures to teach:

- object → label
- process → sequence
- relation → diagram

Then repeat the same concept in multiple forms (picture + count + geometry).

## Layer 3 — Mathematics as the universal compression

Once counting, measurement, and geometry are established, you can teach:

- fractions, ratios
- right triangles
- circles
- coordinate grids

After that, you can encode:

- star maps
- orbital mechanics
- engineering drawings

## Layer 4 — Checksums and redundancy

Assume damage.

- Repeat key tables in multiple places.
- Include “this should equal that” identities.
- Provide small worked examples and answers.
