# Materials

If you want knowledge to persist, **materials matter as much as the message**.

This isn’t a shopping list — it’s a set of constraints.

## Principles

- **Prefer what erodes slowly**
- **Prefer what fails gracefully** (partial readability)
- **Prefer what’s inspectable** without tools
- **Assume water, heat, freeze/thaw, wind, vandalism**

## Candidate mediums

### Stone (baseline)

- Pros: time-tested durability, readable after centuries.
- Cons: expensive to work at scale; heavy; location-specific.

### Fired ceramic / porcelain

- Pros: very durable, high detail, chemically stable.
- Cons: brittle; impact damage.

### Stainless / titanium plates

- Pros: precise engraving; high information density.
- Cons: corrosion in harsh environments; theft risk; requires tooling to fabricate.

## Placement strategy

- **Redundancy across sites** beats one “perfect” site.
- Put copies where people naturally shelter: caves, overhangs, old foundations.
- Use geography: avoid flood plains; avoid soft rock; avoid unstable slopes.

## Survivability checklist

- Can a reader still extract value if **30% is missing**?
- If the site is buried, will it remain readable when uncovered?
- If the surface is vandalized, is there a protected inner layer?
