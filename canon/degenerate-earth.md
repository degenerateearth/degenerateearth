## Constraints

This Codex is written under deliberate constraints.

What is recorded here is limited to what can be preserved through durable matter and minimal interpretation.  
If a concept cannot be carved in stone, etched in glass, or reconstructed without shared language, it is excluded.

These constraints are not symbolic.  
They are applied.

### Material Viability
All knowledge recorded in the Codex must be expressible using permanent, non-electronic media.

Assumed substrates include:
- stone
- metal
- glass
- fired clay

Anything that depends on:
- electricity
- computation
- compression
- playback
- proprietary tooling

is rejected.

### Language Independence
The Codex assumes linguistic collapse.

Entries must remain interpretable without reliance on any specific spoken or written language.

Where language is used, it functions only as a scaffold.  
Meaning must be recoverable through structure, repetition, proportion, or physical reference.

If understanding requires fluency, the entry fails.

### Form
Legibility precedes completeness.

Text is minimized.  
Symbols are constrained.  
Diagrams are favored only when they can be reproduced by hand and decoded without annotation.

No entry depends on color, motion, sound, or cultural convention.

### Scope
Only knowledge that survives abstraction is recorded.

Procedures, measurements, and relationships are favored over description.

Knowledge that cannot be reduced to:
- count
- ratio
- geometry
- sequence
- observable cause and effect

is excluded.

### Permanence
The Codex is written for recovery, not continuity.

It assumes:
- interruption
- damage
- partial survival
- misordering

Redundancy is intentional.  
Elegance is secondary.

### Authorship
The Codex is authored.

It is not open to contribution, revision, or negotiation.

What appears here reflects completed work.  
Absence is deliberate.

### Revision
Errors may be corrected.  
Entries may be removed.

No addition is guaranteed permanence.  
Nothing is preserved by default.

### Final Constraint
If a piece of knowledge cannot survive loss of language, technology, and context, it does not belong here.
