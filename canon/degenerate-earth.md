# Canon: Degenerate Earth

Degenerate Earth is a street‑art‑tinted myth — classical marble and modern noise, gold cracks and hard truth.

It’s not “luxury.” It’s not “ironic.” It’s **worn philosophy**.

## Mission

Create artifacts that feel like they were dug up from the future.

A brand can be more than merch. It can be a signal:

- **Beauty survives.**
- **Meaning outlasts trend.**
- **The human story is older and stranger than we act like.**

## Tone

- **Classical** (forms, proportion, myth)
- **Ruptured** (cracks, erosion, stencil, spray)
- **Defiant** (not polished, not begging approval)

## Principles

1. **The image must hold up at a distance.**
2. **Details are rewards, not requirements.**
3. **Every drop has a thesis.** If it’s empty, it’s noise.
4. **File durability matters.** If the design can’t be exported cleanly, it isn’t finished.
