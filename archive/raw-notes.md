# Raw Notes

This is a sandbox for ideas that aren’t canon yet.

Drop scraps here:

- half‑formed concepts
- quotes
- rough outlines
- links

If a note survives time and still matters, it graduates into **Canon** or **Obelisk**.

This draft panel explores a language-independent method for transmitting basic arithmetic to a post-collapse civilization. It maps tally marks to abstract numerals, defines equality, addition, subtraction, and multiplication through visual equivalence, and introduces base-10 scaling via repeated powers of ten. The intent is to allow reconstruction of modern numerical systems without reliance on spoken or written language.
