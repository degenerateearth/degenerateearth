# Codex

Welcome to **Codex: Degenerate Earth** — a simple, durable home for the ideas behind the brand and the projects that orbit it.

This site is built on purpose:

- **Readable** — plain language, plain files.
- **Portable** — clone it, mirror it, print it, archive it.
- **Persistent** — no platform drama, no fragile dashboards.

## What you’ll find here

- **Mission & Canon** → the “why” and the core identity.
- **Obelisk** → the knowledge‑preservation pillar (engineering-first, survivability-minded).
- **Design** → symbols, iconography, and constraints that keep the aesthetic coherent.
- **Archive** → raw notes and scraps that may become canon later.

## Start here

- Read the **Canon**: [Degenerate Earth](./canon/degenerate-earth/)
- Enter **Obelisk**: [Obelisk Index](./obelisk/)

### The rule

If it can’t survive copy‑paste, print, and time — it doesn’t belong in the Codex.
