## Why this exists

Most human knowledge is fragile.

It lives on servers, behind logins, inside proprietary formats, or in places that assume uninterrupted continuity. History suggests that assumption is false.

Civilizations forget.  
Formats decay.  
Power fails.

The Codex is an attempt to reduce loss.

## Principles

- **Legibility over novelty**  
  What is preserved must be readable without context, training, or tools.

- **Redundancy over efficiency**  
  Important knowledge should exist in multiple forms, even if that seems wasteful.

- **Clarity over elegance**  
  Precision matters more than beauty.

- **Survivability over optimization**  
  If something cannot survive disruption, it does not belong here.

## What is contained here

This repository contains structured attempts to record:

- Fundamental concepts
- Systems of representation
- Methods of encoding information
- Warnings, constraints, and failure modes
- Ideas intended to be recoverable by future readers

Some material is speculative.  
Some is incomplete.  
All of it is written with the assumption that the reader may not share our language, tools, or context.

## The Obelisk Project

A major focus of this Codex is the **Obelisk Project** — an exploration of how knowledge might be encoded in durable, non-digital forms capable of surviving extreme time horizons.

This includes:
- Physical encoding strategies
- Symbol systems
- Mathematical baselines
- Material considerations
- Interpretability constraints

The Obelisk is not a monument.  
It is a *medium*.

## Intended reader

You are not assumed to be:
- A customer
- A follower
- A contemporary

You are assumed only to be:
- Intelligent
- Curious
- Arriving after something has been lost

## Status

This Codex is incomplete by design.  
It will evolve slowly.  
Revisions favor caution over speed.

Nothing here is final.  
Nothing here is accidental.
